# Academic Quest
#### Connecting you to knowledge. Where dreams take shape


> This project is part of the Information Processing and Retrieval Curricular Unit @ FEUP.

One of the major challenges students face is deciding which degree to pursue in higher education. The vast amount of options can seem daunting. To make matters worse, it doesn’t help that this information is scattered on the web.
Each university presents its information in a different fashion, making it hard even to find out which courses make up each degree.
AcademicQuest makes it easy to access this information, as it provides an easy-to-use **search system** that can answer questions such as "Where can I learn marketing?" and "Which degree will make me a journalist?".
This is done with the aid of web-scraping on the university website and posterior organization of the information.
